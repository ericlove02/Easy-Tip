# Easy-Tip

Easy Tip is a React Native project I began working on, but decided not to finish. The app/website were intended to be a simple and modern way for users to tip front-line workers. The idea worked by having clients create an account on the Easy Tip website, creating a location, and adding worked to their location. Workers would then be given specialized QR Codes generated through the Easy Tip website with a PHP QR code package, containing data linked directly to the worked and location. Alternatively, users could select nearby locations and recieve a list of workers to select from. Users could then give tips to specific worked by scanning their badge or other personalized item. The user could then enter a tip amount, and select a previously saved card. The payment would then go through the Stripe API to be accepted by the host. We would keep a ledger of tips earned and distribute it to the locations/workers.   
   
Easy Tip only ever got a shell of a front end and a portion of a back-end, but was ended after I discovered that a very similar app was already in development by a group called YouTip.
